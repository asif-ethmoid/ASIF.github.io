# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster 🚢  

This is the legendary **Titanic ML competition** – the perfect beginner-friendly challenge to dive into machine learning competitions and get familiar with the **Kaggle** platform.  

The goal is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.  

## 🔹 Key Highlights  
- Introduction to **Supervised Learning**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (**EDA**)  
- Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing  
- Model Training & Evaluation  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes details about the passengers, such as:  
- Name, Age, Gender  
- Passenger Class (Pclass)  
- Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp)  
- Number of Parents/Children Aboard (Parch)  
- Ticket Fare, Embarkation Port, etc.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning models  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/asif-ethmoid/Titanic-ML.git
   cd Titanic-ML
